# Code of Conduct for the EMBO Workshop 2023

We are committed to making the EMBO Workshop 2023 an inclusive and welcoming event for everyone. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This Code of Conduct has been created to guarantee a safe and respectful environment to everyone and to have avenues to turn in case someone believes there has been a breach to the Code of Conduct.

## Applicability

This Code of Conduct is applicable not only to the conference itself but also during the event social activities, meetings and at the meals associated with the event.

By participating in the EMBO Workshop 2023, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the EMBO Workshop 2023 Organising Committee resolves any Code of Conduct incidents.

## Expected Behavior

- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group.
- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- The display of sexual or violent images.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications.
- Insults or put downs.

- Incitement to violence or self-harm.
- Continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being asked to stop.

- Deliberate false accusations – the purpose of this Code of Conduct is to protect participants against misconduct, it is not in place to resolve personal disagreements. 

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any participant, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the workshop without warning.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a workshop organizer as soon as possible. You can also report violations anonymously or get assistance by contacting us via contacting the organizers or embo@bsc.es.

We value your attendance and are dedicated to providing a positive workshop experience for everyone. We expect all participants to adhere to this Code of Conduct at all workshop venues and workshop-related social events.
